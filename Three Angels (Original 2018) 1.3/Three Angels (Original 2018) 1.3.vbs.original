'
'PLAYERS					 :	1P Only
'MODES					 :	Three Angels is a "history pin". This is supposed to be a pinball
'								were the history is very important for the game. It's not about
'								making big points, get all lights on or the big score ever.
'								Three Angels is about getting yourself "into" the game. Fighting
'								against Evil and bringing Light into Darkness.
'								Of course each	part of the history could be considered a mode,
'								but there are no really "modes" as we usually understand them...
'								And that's good?... well I think so, but you know... there are a
'								6 billion people out there, and everyone has his own opinion. So
'								play some games and try to get some fun!
'
'WIZARD MODE			 :	Of course. And in my humble opinion, that's the best part of
'								the game. Is a epic battle between Good and Evil forces.
'								How you get threre? Well, it's easy, there is a powerfull guy in
'								the playfield, they call him the Wishmaster. If you gave him 666
'								souls he will open the Gates of Hell for thou!
'								BTW: the backglass image is an scene of that final mode.

' I would like to include a nice phrase that Fluffybot said:
'
' << Put a man in a room with a thousand books for a year and when he comes out,
' chances are he'll be able to recite many lines of literature to you. But if
' you put a man in a room with a thousand sheets of paper and a pen, in a year's
' time you might find yourself holding a book you've never read before.>>
'
'															I'm totally agree with him.

'5.- I see... Seems right, aint?
'6.- But there is a small time lap, between opening the trap entrance and the ball reaching the opto/kicker in the entrance.
'7.- And?
'8.- But what happens if the player lost his ball when the trap entrance is opened but the demon still didnt reach the opto/kicker?

' Explanation of the rolling sound routine
'******************************************

' sounds are played based on the ball speed and position

' the routine checks first for deleted balls and stops the rolling sound.

' The For loop goes through all the balls on the table and checks for the ball speed and 
' if the ball is on the table (height lower than 30) then then it plays the sound
' otherwise the sound is stopped, like when the ball has stopped or is on a ramp or flying.

' The sound is played using the VOL, AUDIOPAN, AUDIOFADE and PITCH functions, so the volume and pitch of the sound
' will change according to the ball speed, and the AUDIOPAN & AUDIOFADE functions will change the stereo position
' according to the position of the ball on the table.


'**************************************
' Explanation of the collision routine
'**************************************

' The collision is built in VP.
' You only need to add a Sub OnBallBallCollision(ball1, ball2, velocity) and when two balls collide they 
' will call this routine. What you add in the sub is up to you. As an example is a simple Playsound with volume and paning
' depending of the speed of the collision.
