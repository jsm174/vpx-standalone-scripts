'IPD No. 528 - 4 players
'© Gottlieb 1991
' VPX recreation by Tom Tower & Ninuzzu 
' Later updated by Bigus (Mod 1.0)

'******************************************************************
'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.0 by UnclePaulie *********
'******************************************************************

' - Ball shadow subroutine off, turned back on.
' - Added all the VR Cab primatives
' - Backglass Image from Blacksad's B2S file... Note:  ONLY used the dark image.  
' - Added the alphanumeric displays from Mousin' Around, and then increased to 40 digits.
' - Added apron walls to block seeing through
' - Moved the apron forward, and adjusted the height so you can see ball come out
' - Matched colors for flipper buttons to cabinet - made red (real ones black, but hard to see)
' - Added two different VR room environments
' - Rails on left and right removed
' - The back flashers are too bright (F22r1,1x,2,2x,3,4,F23r,F24r1,r2,F25x) Changed all to 100
' - The (primative 33) was really bright.  Set blend disable underneath to 1.  Also set regular blend to .3.
' - The light13 was high, turned intensity down to 7. (was 35)
' - Changed the intensity of the lights (L36,37,46,47) to 50.  Was 150 and 200.
' - Changed the intensity of the lights (L67,67a) to 5.  Was 10.
' - Changed tilt sensitivity to 1
' - Added GI to backglass
' - Changed the ball image and added jp_scratches for decal to enhance the ball rolling realism
' - Modified the shapes of lights 1,2,3,4,5,6,15,17.  These are near the slings and flippers.  The original author
'   was trying to have the light blocked by the posts, but it looked really bad in VR.
' - Fixed issue of entering initials when getting a high score.  It required service buttons, however I tied to the left/right flippers now

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.0 by Sixtoe *********

' - Sixtoe made some lighting modifications to flashers.  
'   - Got rid of large lights (F22a,23,24a) and replaced with Flashers 152,153,154 to enable a bloom effect
'   - Cleaned up layer 7 lights to not overlap so much.  The left and top yellow lightgs.  Looks much better in VR.
'   - Moved the right red sidewall flasher as it was in the middle of the table.

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.01 by UnclePaulie *********
' NOTE:  THIS IS NO LONGER VALID.  REAL FIX IS IN 1.3.1
' - There is an issue with the tilt, that if you tilt, and a ball is in play, you might get two balls when it kicks the next ball out
'   The solution was to change the trough slot2_hit to slot2_unhit.  This was resident in Tom Tower and Ninuzzu's original version.

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.1 *********
' - Update to the cabinet, backbox, grill to match the real table.  Also, a new plunger, and added buttons in the front to match.  

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.2 *********
' NOTE:  THIS IS NO LONGER VALID.  REAL FIX IS IN 1.3.1
' ***  Updated two errors in original table.  Sub Slot2 was originally Slot2_Hit().  That caused too many balls to be on table in tilt mode
' ***  once that was changed, there was an issue that caused during the heartbeat multiball, the 2nd ball didn't come into outlane
' ***  the issue was that the Slot1_Hit() updated the trough in the subroutine.  Needed to remove UpdateTrough 

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.3 *********
' Animated the flashers on the backglass

'******** Revisions done on VR version 1.3.1 *********
' Finally fixed the trough issue, and the tilt issue, and the multiball issue.  The issue was that slot1 and slot2 subroutines were reversed.

'******** Revisions done by UnclePaulie on Hybrid version 0.1 - 2.0 *********
' v0.1: Enabled desktop, VR, and cabinet modes
'		Added an optional VR Clock, animated the plunger for VR keyboard use, and animated the flippers
'   	Updated the playfield for slings and triggers holes, and added plywood holes.
' v0.2: Added Fleep Sounds
'		Added nFozzy / Roth physics and flippers.  Updated the flipper physics per recommendations.
'   	Physics (early 90's);  table physics, gravity constant.  Also sling and bumper thresholds changed to match table physics
'		Corrected the Left and Right Gate rotation to RotY direction.  Was incorrect in original version.
'		Aligned SW55.  Also put correct color for primative8.
' v0.3: Added ramp triggers for ramp rolling sounds
'		Changed wall15 height to 70 (was 50).  Ball could jump over.
' v0.4: Changed the drop targets to the solution done by Rothbauerw
'		Modified the sling primatives and sling walls to drop below playfield.  Looks better in VR.
'		Added VPW Dynamic Ball Shadows to the solution done Iakki, Apophis, and Wylte
'		Added a couple wallblocks, as there were a couple times the ball bounced above the bumpers into the open area.  
'			Also made the plastic primative on right side collidable.  Not sure this is the problem, as the bumper force and scatter angle 
'			were increased during my physics updates.  I adjusted them down a little, while keeping the wall blocks.
'		Changed the color of the ramp entrances to black (that's what it is on the real table.)
'		Fixed the teeth movement in VR (solenoid12 conflict)
' 		Continued to fine tune physics on flippers.  
' v0.5	Added Flupper Domes.  
'		Removed all the old flashers for the domes, and the flasherblooms Sixtoe added in old VR version. 
'		Adjusted dome lighting and bloom intensity 
' v0.6	Changed halo height of lighting, as it seemed to "float" above the playfield.  Also clicked, "show mesh" so you can see them lit.
'		Added LUT options with save option 
'		Turned off reflection of some primatieves (23, 33, 34, and sw15s)
'		Added script for cab_mode 
'		Turned down intensity of reflection on ball 
'		Adjusted cab POV
'		Changed plywood cutout wood images
'		Adjusted some of the GI intensities at the top, and the bumpers.
' v0.7	bord - added playfield mesh, removed fallthrough "centerhole" kicker, resized sw52 to give the ball a chance to settle before the grab
' v0.8	Updated ramprolling sounds by fluffhead35 and adding ballroll and ramproll amplication sounds 
' v0.9	Added lighter ball images provided by hauntfreaks and g5k ball scratches, changeable in script 
' v2.0	Release version.
'		Added taller ramp walls and ramp ceilings to prevent balls jumping onto the two ramps (corner conditions)
'		Added invisible glass to keep ball in play (corner condition)
' v2.1	Updated ballrolling logic per recent update by fluffhead35 and apophis
'		Fixed the SW15 spinner not registering.  There was an ' in front of the vpmtimerpulse commande.  Thanks to Lumi for noticing the problem.
' v2.2	Hid the rails in cabinet mode
' v2.3	Sixtoe provided a modified primative 45 for the saucer.

' ******  Gotlieb Add 3 Credits Issue or other ROM issues ******
' **************************************************************

' - If your ROM is adding 3 credits... you need to go into service menu and change center coin slot to 1 credit
'   - Press 7 when starting the game to enter ROM menu
'   - Immediately Press 8 to enter game adjustments
'   - Press 7 to advance to the adjustment you want to modify.  The center slot credit menu is adjustment number 11. 
'   - Press 8 or 9 to increase or decrease the setting.  (In this case, hit 8 twice, to go from 3 to 1)
'   - Press F3 to save

' ***   If the ROM has all the settings blank (i.e. high score, max credits, add credits, etc.) 
'  		This is due to a blank .nv file.  All the settings are defaulted to 0

'	- Follow the instructions above, but you need to modify all the settings.  1 coin = 1 credit.  Max 3 credits,  replay credit, etc.

'****  DROP TARGETS by Rothbauerw
'******************************************************
' This solution improves the physics for drop targets to create more realistic behavior. It allows the ball 
' to move through the target enabling the ability to score more than one target with a well placed shot.
' It also handles full drop target animation, including deflection on hit and a slight lift when the drop 
' targets raise, switch handling, bricking, and popping the ball up if it's over the drop target when it raises.
'
' For each drop target, we'll use two wall objects for physics calculations and one primitive for visuals and   
' animation. We will not use target objects.  Place your drop target primitive the same as you would a VP drop target. 
' The primitive should have it's pivot point centered on the x and y axis and at or just below the playfield 
' level on the z axis. Orientation needs to be set using Rotz and bending deflection using Rotx. You'll find a hooded 
' target mesh in this table's example. It uses the same texture map as the VP drop targets.
