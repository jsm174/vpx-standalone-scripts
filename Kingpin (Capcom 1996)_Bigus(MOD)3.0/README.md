stripped out a lot of the script to get it running.

the power bar doesnt seem to be working properly using the 9 ball mode.
3 ball mode seems to work just fine. (change mode in game dmd rom menu)

rolling sounds bug to stop, so i commented the code and they keep playing when they shouldnt.
I dont know how to fix it.
